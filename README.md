# dropcam
Unofficial Dropcam API Client

## Status
There's no public documentation for this API as most of it was reverse engineered from their private API.
There is a beta program available to access official API resources, however they are selective
towards who can use it. Consider this experimental until further notice as it can
break when their private API is updated. Report any bugs if you come across them.

This project is tested on `Debian GNU/Linux: Jessie`

## Features
- Dropcam Scope
	- Search API - Find any camera publically accessable
	- Demos API - Access various demos available
	- Camera API - Access various functions of a camera
		- User Scope
			- User API
				- Notification Email Management - Manage email notifications
				- User Creation (new) - Create new users
		- Camera Scope
			- Settings - View, manage and modify various camera settings including visibility
			- Screenshots - Capture live screenshots of the camera
			- Clips - View, manage, and modify available clips (update, delete, and download)
			- Notification Devices - View and modify devices that receive notifications to this camera
			- Basic implementation of Events - Get any motion/sound events that occur with this camera
			- Basic implementation of Subscriptions - Get all current subscriptions to this camera
			- ~~Media Capture - Capture real time screenshots and live video streams (requires RTMPDUMP)~~

## TODO
- Subscriptions - Manage and modify subscriptions (partially implemented)
- Capture Video/Sound Streams with the ability to talkback 
- Meaningful Events
- Tests

## Live Video Streams
This is currently broken as they've moved to encrypted streaming. Currently researching new ways to obtain this stream (as of 03/23/2015).

~~This project depends on the use of rtmpdump to capture live video streams. Since there is no reliable
native functionality to capture RTMP streams at the moment (at least to my knowledge), 
you must download and have rtmpdump on your system PATH. To download, visit: http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/download
Tested with RTMPDUMP 2.4 on Win 8.1 64bit.~~

```

## Dropcam API
### .login(username, password, callback)
This function will attempt to login into the private dropcam API 
and returns a user (you) with a valid session if successful. This function
takes three parameters, `username`, `password`, and `callback`. This is considered
the main entry function and must be called before accessing any other APIs.
See above for an example.

### .search(user, public_token, callback)
This function will attempt to search the dropcam API using the public 
token to find the camera that's associated with it. The function takes
a `user` and `public_token`. The callback returns a camera if successful. Login 
must be called before accessing the full camera API. Note: You will
not be able to modify camera settings (such as visibility) unless 
you own the camera. See above for an example.

### .demos(user, callback)
This function will attempt to search for available demos and return an 
array of cameras. Login must be called before accessing the full camera 
API. The function takes a `user`. Note: You will not be able to modify camera 
settings (such as visibility) unless you own the camera. See above for an example.

### .getVisibleCameras(user, callback)
This function will attempt to return an array of visible cameras associated 
with the `user`. Login must be called before accessing the full camera API.
See above for an example.  

## User API
You can access several user properties and session details with a user.

### .addNotificationEmail(email, callback)
This function will attempt to add a new `email` address for notifications and
return an object containing the new address and id. The id is important to have
in the case you wish to later remove the associated email. See above for an
example. 

### .removeNotificationEmail(email_id, callback)
This function will attempt to remove an associated email address with the `email_id` 
and return a true/false depending on success. You can only obtain the id when you create
a new notification email using the API, so it's important to save the id if you plan
on removing it later. See above for an example.

### .Register(username, password, email, callback)
This function registers a new user to dropcam. It takes three parameters, `username`,
`password`, and `email`. Email validation is not included.

## Camera API
Due to wide variety of properties and settings varying per camera, you can access 
all properties by extending the camera's properties, settings and user. You can see an 
example of this in the above example.

You can also call `.on(event, callback)` if you wish to receive the following
motion/sound events. See below on how to capture these events.

### Event: 'motion'
This event receives any motion events detected by this camera
### Event: 'sound'
This event receives any sound events detected by this camera
### Event: 'error'
This event receives any error events that occur

### .toggle(visibility, callback)
This function will attempt to toggle the camera's visibility setting and return the resulting
new setting as `private` or `public`. You can pass in a string such as `private` or `public`
as the visibility parameter. Note: This function will not work on cameras not associated with 
the user. See above for an example.

### .update(keyvalue, callback)
This function will attempt to update a camera setting such as enabling audio, motion
detection, etc and returns a true/false depending on the success. You can see a full list 
of available settings by accessing the settings property on the camera including their values. 
Note: This function will not work on cameras not associated with the user. See above for 
an example.

### .capture(callback)
This function will attempt to capture a live screenshot of the camera and return a screenshot
object. This function should work on both user owned and public cameras. See above for an
example, and see below for object functions.

### .getNotificationDevices(callback)
This function will attempt to get all devices asssociated with this camera and return an array 
of devices that are currently recently notifications. Note: This function will not work on cameras 
not associated with the user. See above for an example.

### .getSubscriptions(callback)
This function will attempt to get any subscriptions associated with this camera and return an
array of subscriptions. Note: This function will not work on cameras not associated with 
the user. See above for an example.

### .getClips(callback)
This function will attempt to get any video clips saved on the cloud and return an array of
clips. See above for an example.

### .listen(timeout)
This function will begin monitoring any motion/sound events that occur with this camera. You
can optionally pass a `timeout` parameter in the case you want to increase/decrease frequency 
of API calls. The default delay is `1000 ms`. Any events captured will be emitted as soon as the 
API knows of the event. Be aware of any delays such as latency to occur. See above for an example 
and which events can be captured.

## Clips API
### .download(callback)
This function will attempt to download a video clip. Returns an object containing the
`filename` and `stream`. Stream contains video clip buffer. See above for an example.

### .update(keyvalue, callback)
This function will attempt to update any properties associated with the clip. The only
properties that seem to be modifiable are `title` and `description`. Returns a true/false
depending on success. See above for an example. 

### .delete(callback)
This function will attempt to delete the clip. Returns true/false depending on success. 
Clip will no longer be usable at this point, call `.getClips` to refresh available clips.
See above for an example.

## Devices API
### .enable(callback)
This function enables the device to begin receiving notifications. You will need to have
the device's `type` and `value` in order to create and enable the device. Returns a true/false 
value depending on success. See above for an example. 

### .disable(callback)
This function disables the device from receiving any notifications. If this function
is called, it will longer show up in the device list. Returns a true/false value depending 
on success. Tip: In order to enable, you should consider persisting the object's properties and 
create a new `Device` object. See above for an example.

## Screenshot
### .pipe(out)
You can call `.pipe` on the object and do what you wish with the buffer, such as writing 
to file. See above for an example.

## Deprecated as of 1.0.0
### .getDevicesWithNotifications
This function has been renamed to `.getNotificationDevices`

## Deprecated as of 1.0.1
### .getSessionToken
This function is no longer used; you can access the session token from `User` node directly via the `session` key. See above for an example. Removed on the next release.
